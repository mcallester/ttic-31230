<header>TTIC 31230: Fundamentals of Deep Learning</header>

<p> David McAllester</p>

<p> Winter 2020</p>

<p> TA: Adam Dziedzic</p>
<p> Grader: Gray Mackall </p>

<p style = "color:red"> Announcement: The office hours have been moved to Monday, Friday 2:00-4:00 in the library rm 435.<p>

<p> In 2020, as in 2019, there will be no machine problems or class projects.  The course will again be treated as an "algorithms class" rather than a "programming class".</p>

<p> The grade will be based entirely on four in-class quizes and a final exam with the final worth 30% and each quiz worth 17.5%. The quizes from laset year, with solutions, are given at the bottom of this page.  Also the course material includes additional paractice problems with solutions.  The quizes and the final will include problems from the practice set --- you just need to memorize the solution --- as well as original problems.</p>
